## Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

### Learning Goals

- Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
- Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks
- Install and get started with Django

### Reflection Questions

1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

   - If the project were small, didn't require a database, or was meant to be completely customizable I would use vanilla Python. If the project was a larger scale, had multiple users, and needed a larger database I would use Django. Django is better for larger applications because of its security, database use, plugins, and DRY philosophy.

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

   - The most significant advantage in my opinion is that the Template replaces the Controller. Which means that instead of having to code the controller yourself, the Template handles the controller output.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement.

   - I want to learn more about the DRY philosophy and practices that Django uses to make it such a renowned framework.
   - I'd like to learn more about the plugins available with Django and how to use them in this achievement as well as in future projects.
   - I'd like to build my own app that uses a database with Python and Django.
