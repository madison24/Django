## Exercise 2.3: Django Models

### Learning Goals

- Discuss Django models, the “M” part of Django’s MVT architecture
- Create apps and models representing different parts of your web application
- Write and run automated tests

### Reflection Questions

1. Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.

   - Django web applications access and manage data through python models. Models define the structure of the data with options such as field types, max length, help text, and more. Django model flexibility along with all the available features, help developers build data centric apps with ease.

2. In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project.

   - I think it’s crucial to write and run tests from the beginning of a project so you can catch bugs earlier rather than later. If you were working on a huge project with multiple files/folders and waited until the very end to test your code and you had failed tests, it would take more time and effort to find and fix everything compared to if you had started testing with your first few files at the beginning of the project.
