## Frontend Inspirations

### Tasty Recipe Page

I chose the page Tasty uses for its individual recipes for inspiration because I like how it is set up. The Recipe Name up top and in the boldest/largest font and going from left to right with the ingredients and directions.

### AllRecipe Page

I chose the page allrecipe uses to show multiple recipes because of how it blocks off 3 recipes per row and I like how it doesn't look too crowded.
